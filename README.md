This script was used for a **complex** engineering operation to remove **100+** old PRs with merge conflicts in the [material-extensions/vscode-material-icon-theme](https://github.com/material-extensions/vscode-material-icon-theme) repository

### Prehistory

> There were 130+ PRs in the [material-extensions/vscode-material-icon-theme](https://github.com/material-extensions/vscode-material-icon-theme) repository, ~100 of them had merge conflicts, of course they could be resolved, but it takes a _very long time_, which is very disadvantageous, even if you ignore the merge conflicts, those PRs were using an outdated the **Material Icons** format, which makes working on them too _time-consuming_

> So we decided to close them
